Project is a *WIP* - needs to be organized before the commits starts rolling in.

In my studies I find the methods of linear algebra and numerical analysis to be very interesting.
Since I am learning the C++20 language (coming from C17) I find it very intuative to write numerical based software.

This library is the product of that.

It will not be the *best* (see GNU Scientific Library or any BLAS/ATLAS for that) - TSL will be an easy-to-use library for your studies.

The goal is also to have this library be usable in games (real-time applications) and be integrated for usage in Python and Julia.

I personally like GSL - however it does have it's issues with trying to implement object-oriented-programming into the C language, as the compiler can not type-check correctly since C is not OOP-based.

Working with abstractions C++ seems like a good candidate.
