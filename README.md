Project is a *WIP* - needs to be organized before the commits starts rolling in.

In my studies I find the methods of linear algebra and numerical analysis to be very interesting.
This library is the product of my mathematical studies.

It will not be the *best* or fastest (see GNU Scientific Library or any BLAS/ATLAS for that) - TSL will be an easy-to-use library for your studies.

The goal is also to have this library be usable in videogames (real-time applications) and be integrated for usage in other languages such as Python and Julia.

I personally like GSL - however it does have its issues with trying to implement object-oriented-programming into the C language, as the compiler can not type-check correctly since C is not OOP-based.

Working with abstractions C++ seems like a good candidate.
